# Reporting for WinForms - Create a Report Dynamically and Bind It to a DataSet

This example demonstrates how to create a report dynamically and bind it to a [DataSet](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400542). Based on a user's choice, either the [XRTable](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRTable) or [XRLabel](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRLabel) control is used to display report data, and the [XRChart](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRChart) control is used to visualize this data.

If you want to create a report based on [GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl) data, use the [ReportGenerator](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.ReportGeneration.ReportGenerator) class as described in the following help topic: [Advanced Grid Printing and Exporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/114962/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/export-and-printing/advanced-grid-printing-and-exporting).
